Blackjack game buildiung as a Module using JavaScript , CSS and HTML It was hosted in Githug Pages https://rogeralbp.github.io/blackjack/

In this demo it was possible to put into practice the step by step of a file in its development phase and then to minimize it for its production

in the same way, the game security when working as a module provides greater security in terms of manipulation by cheating players haha
